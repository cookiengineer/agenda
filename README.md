# Cookie Engineer's Agenda Task Planning Tool

I hate all task planning apps, including Micro$oft products that
never interact well with standalone apps, cli tools or calendars.

This is my attempt of creating a standalone task planning tool,
which aims to be focus-based, without any interruptions, and tries
to suggest "what to work on" at any given time, without having to
think about missing something.

As all other tools are usually only Work-related task planning
tools, they miss out all dependencies of real-life appointments,
like having to go to the doctor with your cat, having to buy
groceries or having to repetitively wash and iron your clothes
in an irregular manner.

This tool aims to solve this, in a very opinionated manner.


## Quickstart

```bash
# Run Web Server and Backend API
go run agenda.go;

# Open Chromium-based Web Browser
gio open http://localhost:13337;
```
